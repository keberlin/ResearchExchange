Application:

- The application has been written as a standard Flask app with local IP address: http://127.0.0.1:81

- To run the application use: python app.py

- http://127.0.0.1:81/request will be the main access point to the engine. It can use either GET, POST or DELETE protocols

  GET with an id parameter, eg /request/id=1 - returns a list of subscriptions for a single user
  GET with no parameters, eg /request - returns a list of subscriptions for all users

  POST with json data email & title - registers a book subscription for a user

  DELETE with an id parameter - removes a user along with all their subscriptions


Python requirements(.txt):

- The application depends on 'Flask' pip install package


Assumptions:

It's been assumed that the system has a preset list of books within its database upon startup. And that each POST request
is effectively setting up a book subscription. So this implies that there are tables for a list of books, a list of users
(subscribers) and a list of subscriptions.

So the GET request will return the following if a user is specified:

{'email':email, 'id':id, 'titles': [subscriptions], 'timestamp': timestamp}

and if no user specified a list of all users details like so:

{'users': ['email':email, 'id':id, 'titles': [subscriptions]], 'timestamp': timestamp}

Ie the timestamp will only be listed the once for each request.


Examples using curl:

Add a subscription with a fresh user:
  curl -X POST -d '{"email":"keith@gmail.com","title":"Terminator"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:81/request

Add a subscription with an existing user:
  curl -X POST -d '{"email":"keith@gmail.com","title":"Harry Potter"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:81/request

Add a subscription with another fresh user:
  curl -X POST -d '{"email":"timmy@gmail.com","title":"War and Peace"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:81/request

List all active users and their subscriptions:
  curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:81/request

Remove a user and all their subscriptions:
  curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:81/request?id=1

List all remaining active users and their subscriptions:
  curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:81/request
